# BananaStand

No, BananaStand doesn't stand for anything, except bananas.

These are scripts that can be used for processing amplicon data and have been tried on 16S rRNA and ITS sequencing. It will be periodically updated.

At the heart of this software (I love saying that because this is really just a trashy pipeline that I smooshed together during my first year of grad school with no real training in writing code (I guess I still don't have any training :sob:)) is the mpipe.py wrapper. This throws all of these scripts together.

# Installation

You're gonna wanna go ahead and clone this repository like this 

`git clone https://github.com/bulksoil/BananaStand.git`

Youre also gonna wanna go ahead and get that PandaSeq by [going over to their page](https://github.com/neufeld/pandaseq) and following their download instructions based on your system. If I remember correctly, it's fairly easy. You can probably just brew install it.

The next thing you want to do is make sure that you get these scripts into some directory that is in your path. It should be ready to go.

# How to do a microbiome experiment (I mean, how I do a microbiome experiment)

I will get around to updating this sometime in the future.

# Citation
If you decided to use these tools, we kindly ask that you cite the original work where it [originated](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/8/E911.abstract, "This was my first paper, homie"). We also ask that you cite [PandaSeq](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-13-31) - as this pipeline requires it to do its thing.
